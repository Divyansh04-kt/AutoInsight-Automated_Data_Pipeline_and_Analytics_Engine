# 📊 Automatic Insights Generator
## 📌 Project Overview

The Automatic Insights Generator is a web-based application that allows users to upload a dataset (CSV file) and automatically generate meaningful insights, visualizations, and a professional PDF report.
The system analyzes the data, identifies patterns, and presents results in both graphical and textual formats, making data interpretation easy even for non-technical users.

## 🎯 Objectives
1) To automate data analysis and insight generation
2) To provide graphical visualization of data
3) To generate a structured PDF report with summaries and insights
4) To simplify data interpretation using AI-style explanations

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
🔹 Backend
Python

Flask

🔹 Data Processing
Pandas

NumPy

🔹 Visualization
Matplotlib

Plotly

🔹 Report Generation
ReportLab

🔹 Frontend
HTML

CSS

## ⚙️ Features
